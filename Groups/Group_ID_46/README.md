<b>Project Structure</b>

This project has two major parts :

<b>pixel_features.py -</b> This code contains class for extracting features related to pixel of an image like Mean, Median, Mode of different channels (R,G,B) and also for entire image.

<b>Edge_Features.py -</b> This code contains class for extracting edge features of an image using Canny Edge Detection algorithm and Prewitt's horizontal and vertical edge detector.

- We showcase the usage of above mentioned classes with examples in different .ipynb files named as:
  - pixel_mean.ipynb
  - pixel_median.ipynb
  - pixel_mode.ipynb
  - Edge_Detection_Canny.ipynb
  - Edge_Features_Prewitt.ipynb
