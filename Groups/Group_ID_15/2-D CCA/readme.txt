step1: Firstly User has to call mainfunction().
step2 : user has to enter the value for matrices.
step3: After entering matrices user will get the output corresponding to the value like first he will get  covariance matrix of left and right transform w.r.t X and Y.
step4: user will get the matrices for right transform after calculating of cov(x,y) , cov(x,x), cov(y,y).
step5: user will get the matrices for left transform after calculating of cov(x,y) , cov(x,x), cov(y,y).
