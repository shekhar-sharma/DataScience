The following folder contains a detailed description and implementation of KCCA and RCCA on a multiview dataset in python.

KCCA methods are used for feature extraction from multiview datas to a single view.<br>
RCCA methods are used for feature extraction and also help to reduce calculations by applying RCCA algorithm on some random points.
