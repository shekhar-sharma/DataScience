The following folder contains a detailed description and implementation of LPCCA on a multiview dataset in python.

LPCCA  and ALPCCAis a linear multivariate statistical analysis method for dimensionality reduction and feature fusion for better analysis and evaluation of multivariate data.

The LPCCA following folder contains 3 files:

# LPCCA_report.pdf:
This file contains the analysis and description of the core concepts of multiview learning(primarily focussing on CCA and LPCCA)

# LPCCA.py:
This file contains the implementation of LPCCA in python on any two dimensional
or view data.

# exapmle.py:
Contains a sample code on feature extraction and reduction using the above module.
